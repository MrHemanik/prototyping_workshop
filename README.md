# Prototyping Workshop
A repository housing my game prototypes created during the "Prototyping" course as part of my master's degree at Hochschule Flensburg.

## Prototype 1: One Button Game
**Premise: Develop a prototype that only uses one button as input**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: None/English**

I created a 2D Unity game that revolves around controlling a ball solely using the spacebar (as only one button is allowed). The ball-direction is indicated with an arrow that rotates around the player, as seen in the first picture. When the player presses and holds the spacebar, the direction becomes fixed, and the longer they maintain this action, the more forceful their propulsion becomes. The objective is to reach the level's goal. 

**External Sources:** This prototype uses the Tileset [Outdoor Tiles Again](https://opengameart.org/content/outdoor-tiles-again) from [Michele "Buch" Bucelli](https://opengameart.org/content/outdoor-tiles-again).

## Prototype 2: No Screen
**Premise: Develop a prototype that uses no visual output**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: German**

I used Unity to create a multiple-choice dialogue about finding oneself in purgatory, where one talks with an automated system that handles new souls. Depending on the player's choice, they will either get obliterated or be sent on their way to find their salvation in an "endless void". The endless void is in the form of a maze, through which the player needs to traverse with audio cues. Once completed, a glitch will reset the game, where the player can either endlessly try to find their salvation or give up and obliterate themselves.

**External Sources:** To create the dialogue audio files, the text-to-speech service https://ttsfree.com/ was used. For the button-press sound modified versions of "Dial 0 on Touch Tone Telephone" to "Dial 9 on Touch Tone Telephone" from https://freesfx.co.uk/sfx/dial were used.

## Prototype 3: Pictograms

**Premise: Develop a prototype that only uses pictograms. Original prompt name: 'Susan Kares Dreams'**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: None**

For this prompt, a 2D incremental auto-clicker game has been created. The task is to click on the phone to gather hearts. Click upgrades can be purchased to increase the number of hearts produced per click. Alternatively, an auto-clicker upgrade is available to perform the clicking automatically. The produced heart amount and the time between clicks can be upgraded as well.
Designing this prototype was challenging, as I couldn't use normal images or even solid-colored rectangles for UI.

For Audio, these sounds were used:
[Click On Phone](https://freesound.org/people/Raclure/sounds/483600/),
[Open/Close Shop](https://freesound.org/people/plasterbrain/sounds/396193/),
[Upgrade Bought](https://freesound.org/people/Jagadamba/sounds/254756/),
[Upgrade Denied](https://freesound.org/people/burnttoys/sounds/9243/)

## Prototype 4: Scrolling

**Premise: Develop a prototype with scrolling as the main interaction**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: English**


For this prompt, a rhythm game has been created. Choose between three different songs to play, where each can be played with x0.8, x1, x.1.5 or x2 speed. Scrolling with the mouse wheel moves the player up and down. The task is to hit the notes with the ball, only playing the note when the player hits it. Each level is generated from a file, where each note is defined.

**External Sources:** The UI-Images are from <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-retro-computer-windows-element_41775760.htm#query=windows%20ui&position=3&from_view=keyword&track=ais">Freepik</a>.
The audio for each level is generated with an Oscillator-Script, using elements from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqHFGMy_51c). For button-clicks, this sound was used: [Button Click](https://freesound.org/people/Jagadamba/sounds/254756/).

## Prototype 5: Read The Fucking Manual (RTFM)

**Premise: Develop a prototype where a manual is needed for**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: English**

This is a two-player game. Player one has a manual and player two plays on the device. Player one may not see the screen and player two may not see the manual. They need to communicate to solve different problems, each with randomized components. They need to finish their tasks before the safety level reaches 0%.

## Prototype 6: From The Future

**Premise: Develop a prototype with an interface that could be from a Sci-Fi movie**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: English**

The player is lost in space. They need to use their remaining fuel to travel to planets, collect resources and repair their ship. The goal is to collect 100 Plasma Resin to repair the FTL Drive to fly back home. If there is no fuel remaining, the player will be lost in space, thus failing.
