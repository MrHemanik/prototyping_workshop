# Prototyping Workshop
A repository housing my game prototypes created during the "Prototyping" course as part of my master's degree at Hochschule Flensburg.

## Prototype 1: One Button Game
**Premise: Develop a prototype that only uses one button as input**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: None/English**

I created a 2D Unity game that revolves around controlling a ball solely using the spacebar (as only one button is allowed). The ball-direction is indicated with an arrow that rotates around the player, as seen in the first picture. When the player presses and holds the spacebar, the direction becomes fixed, and the longer they maintain this action, the more forceful their propulsion becomes. The objective is to reach the level's goal. 
This prototype uses the Tileset [Outdoor Tiles Again](https://opengameart.org/content/outdoor-tiles-again) from [Michele "Buch" Bucelli](https://opengameart.org/content/outdoor-tiles-again).

## Prototype 2: No Screen
**Premise: Develop a prototype that uses no visual output**<br>
**Developed with: Unity**<br>
**Language: German**

I used Unity to create a multiple-choice dialogue about finding oneself in purgatory, where one talks with an automated system that handles new souls. Depending on the player's choice, they will either get obliterated or be sent on their way to find their salvation in an "endless void". The endless void is in the form of a maze, through which the player needs to traverse with audio cues. Once completed, a glitch will reset the game, where the player can either endlessly try to find their salvation or give up and obliterate themselves.

To create the dialogue audio files, the text-to-speech service https://ttsfree.com/ was used. For the button-press sound modified versions of "Dial 0 on Touch Tone Telephone" to "Dial 9 on Touch Tone Telephone" from https://freesfx.co.uk/sfx/dial were used.
